# Collectivism_covid-19_SSD2024
The analysis of various kinds of data from different existing sources, merged on the country level, related to COVID-19. Depending on the source, it contains world or selection of European coutries. 

The coresponding article will be published at Slovene Sociological Association's (SSD) journal Družboslovne razprave (Social Science Forum) in the next issue. 

Different types of data from existing sources were combined on the level of a country as a unit of analysis (Hofstede 2011; Erikson 2021; European Parliament 2021; European Commission 2021, 2022; Google LLC 2021). 

The analysis uses two-dimensional graphs of countries’ positions and Pearson correlations. Measures of cultural orientations were extended and also includes country aggregate measures of trust in government, attitudes regarding freedom, and how common conspiracy beliefs are.
